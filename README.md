# Improved quasi-static method solver based on OpenFOAM - KaiyangIQS.

This is a neutron space-time kinetics solver with improved quasi-static method based on OpenFOAM. This solver is named as KaiyangIQS, which will be a toolkit of Kaiyang Code (北斗第六 - 开阳). The algorithm, numerical methods, and validated cases can be referred from: *Development of a neutron space-time kinetics solver with improved quasi-static method based on OpenFOAM, Nuclear Engineering and Design (under review)*
